**Short Term Trend:** The predictions indicate a mixed short-term trend with slight fluctuations. The price is generally expected to hover around the mid-$70s, with a few peaks above $77.

**Long Term Trend:** The overall trajectory signals a potential increase, given the initial decline followed by upward price movements towards $77, although there's a drop expected by March 1.

**Trading Suggestions:** 
1. **Buy on Dips:** Consider buying during predicted lower prices around $74, leveraging potential rebounds as short-term volatility suggests opportunities for gains.
2. **Monitor Resistance Levels:** If prices break above consistent resistances, it might indicate a stronger upward trend; prepare for potential buys.
3. **Consider Exit Near Peaks:** For short-term trades, selling at forecasted peaks (around $77) could maximize profits before a potential drop. Always pair these strategies with risk management practices.
