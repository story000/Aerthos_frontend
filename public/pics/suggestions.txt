**Short Term Trend:** The forecast indicates slight fluctuations with a general upward bias in the short term, reaching a peak at 82.7215 on February 6 before correcting. Prices hover around the low 80s, suggesting mild volatility.

**Long Term Trend:** Given the current upward trajectory in recent prices along with predicted stabilization, a long-term trend may suggest potential continued growth beyond current predictions, considering the forecast surpasses recent highs observed in the data.

**Trading Suggestions:**  
1. **Buy:** Consider purchasing when prices briefly dip (e.g., on February 10) around 80.5766 to take advantage of a lower entry point.  
2. **Sell:** Monitor for selling opportunities at forecasted peaks (e.g., around February 6 or February 9) if quick profits align with your trading strategy.  
3. **Hold:** If focused on long-term growth, a hold strategy may also be considered given the predicted stabilization at higher levels.
