**Short Term Trend:** The predicted price for the coming days shows a slight downward trend, with the price decreasing from around 68 to 65.79 before a minor recovery to 67.92. This suggests short-term volatility with a potential dip.

**Long Term Trend:** While the short-term forecasts show a decline, there are no longer-term predictions provided. However, based on this short horizon, the trend suggests a weaker price environment if downward momentum continues beyond the forecasts.

**Trading Suggestions:** 
1. **Short term:** Consider selling if holding positions, as prices are predicted to decline. Watch for the predicted low around April 9.
2. **Medium term:** Monitor closely for the minor recovery around April 16, which might provide a short-term buying opportunity if confirmed by other indicators.
3. **Risk Management:** Implement stop-loss orders to mitigate potential losses, especially in volatile conditions.
