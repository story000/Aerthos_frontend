**Short Term Trend:** The immediate trend indicates a downward movement, with prices consistently predicted to fall from 71.33 to 65.40 by March 27. 

**Long Term Trend:** Prices are expected to rebound slightly after March 27, rising to 70.04 by April 2, suggesting a potential recovery.

**Trading Suggestions:**  
1. **Short-Term Sell:** Capitalize on the expected decline by selling before March 25, as prices are predicted to decrease significantly.
2. **Re-evaluate Post-March 27:** Monitor market movements closely around March 27 for possible intervention opportunities, as prices are anticipated to reverse direction.
3. **Consider Buying at Low:** With predictions indicating potential recovery by early April, consider buying when prices are near their lowest (around March 27) to benefit from the expected recovery.
