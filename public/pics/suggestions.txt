**Short Term Trend**: The predictions indicate a mixed short-term trend with some fluctuations around the lower 70s to mid-70s, showing a bounce back after a dip, and then a stabilization around 77.5.

**Long Term Trend**: The historical data shows a gradual increase from the 74 range to over 80, followed by a slight decline back into the high 70s. This suggests a bullish long-term trend, with potential for price recovery towards previous highs.

**Trading Suggestions**:
1. **Buy on Dips**: Consider buying when the price dips around the lower 70s, as there's a likelihood of resurgence based on past patterns.
2. **Sell Near Resistance**: If prices approach the high 70s, consider selling as resistance may occur and prevent further rise.
3. **Monitor Predictions**: Use predicted values to time entries and exits, especially if the market hovers near predicted support and resistance levels.
