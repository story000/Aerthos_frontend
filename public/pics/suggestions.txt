**Short Term Trend:**  
The short-term trend indicates a continuous decline in prices. Predictions show a drop from 68.6752 to 65.4795 within a few days, suggesting bearish momentum.

**Long Term Trend:**  
Over the longer period, prices are consistently trending downwards from a high of 83.79 to the predicted values around the mid-60s. This suggests a persistent bearish trend, pointing towards further declines if no positive market changes occur.

**Trading Suggestions:**  
1. **Sell Short Term:** Capitalize on the anticipated near-term decline by selling in the short term to mitigate losses or maximize profits.
2. **Monitor for Reversal Signals:** Stay vigilant for any macroeconomic shifts or policy changes that might reverse the bearish trend before long-term commitments.
3. **Risk Management:** Implement stop-loss orders to protect against unexpected price increases, ensuring minimized risk during trades.
